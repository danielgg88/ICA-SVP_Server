ICAPR-RSVP: Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) measuring tool based on pupillary response during RSVP reading 
========

Background
--------- 
The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) is an estimation of the cognitive effort in a given period of time and it can be calculated based on the user's pupillary response (dilation) when it interacts with a visual display. Estimating ICA does not require averaging over trials and it can be applied to a signal of any length. For this reason, it can be computed in real time.

Software
--------- 
ICAPR-RSVP is a real-time ICA measuring tool that analyses pupillary activity samples during Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). By using RSVP, accurate estimation can be done due to the known-in-advance presentation timing of each item because it allows the matching of an specific pupillary response and the stimuli causing it.
